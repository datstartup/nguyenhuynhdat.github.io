<p>Mistral Theme</p>

<p>At the beginning of my Openbox experience, I used the default theme of Crunchbang and it still is pretty good. Now I am using a theme call <strong>Mistral</strong>.</p>

<p>The author has posted it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://phobi4n.deviantart.com/art/Mistral-Openbox-543910044">http://phobi4n.deviantart.com/art/Mistral-Openbox-543910044</a></p>

<p>This is one of the some rare Openbox themes that I can recommend, others are often very spartan and have very few sense of modern.</p>

<p>In this case of Mistral, the theme is contained in a folder, but Openbox themes also come with .obt extension and can be installed using Obconf. You also can extracted that .obt package to a folder using any of compression tool.</p>

<p>After having the theme folder, please move it into one of these directories below. They are where Openbox will look for its theme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System-wide themes are installed in: <strong>/usr/share/themes</strong>.</li>
  <li>User-specific themes are in: <strong>~/.local/share/themes</strong> or in <strong>~/.themes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Themes will be instantly registered into Obconf for you to use.</p>

<p>Open <strong>Obconf</strong> by typing the command <strong>obconf</strong> into terminal. Select Mistral theme.</p>

<p>I have to say that although it is easy, at the beginning I struggled to know all of these. Hope all the articles on this website will save you some time!</p>
