<h2 id="gtk-theme-for-ubuntu-openbox">GTK theme for Ubuntu Openbox</h2>

<p>GTK themes will define the appearance of applications on your system: the interfaces, the color of the taskbar (lxpanel only, tint2 will use its own configuration), the backgrounds for windows and tabs, the looks of GTK applications.</p>

<p>As oppose to Openbox theme which defines the <strong>OUTSIDE</strong> - the title and the windows border, an GTK theme defines the look of what are <strong>INSIDE</strong> that windows border.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normal GTK+ apps (Firefox, Transmission, Geany…)</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the things you should consider when install a theme is that which theme engines are needed. The creator of the theme often will tell you which theme engines will go with it.</p>

<p><strong>Install a GTK theme:</strong></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded a theme, place it into either of these directories: <strong>~/.themes</strong> or <strong>/usr/share/themes</strong>.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate with my system. We will install <strong>FlatStudioGray</strong> theme and you can download it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/FlatStudio?content=154296">http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/FlatStudio?content=154296</a></p>

<p>Extract the downloaded package.</p>

<p>Then, move extracted <strong>Flatstudio</strong> theme folder into <strong>~/.theme</strong> folder.</p>

<p>In Linux, every file/folder with its name begin with a period (.) is hidden.The <strong>“.theme”</strong> folder is often hidden and we need to unhide it: Using Thunar &gt; View &gt; Check “Show Hidden File”.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Terminal_split.jpg" alt="terminator" /></p>

<p>Now you can see ~/.theme folder and move Flatstudio folder to it.</p>

<p>As I have said, you need theme engines to make the theme look exactly like it supposes to. As with this theme, the author have instructed us to install <strong>unico-engine</strong> &amp; <strong>gtk2-engines-murrine</strong>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install unico-engine gtk2-engines-murrine
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Open <strong>Lxappearance</strong> (by the command <strong>lxappearance</strong>) &gt; Under the <strong>Widget</strong> tab, choose <strong>Flatstudio</strong>.</p>

<p>And Voila! All should look good now.</p>
