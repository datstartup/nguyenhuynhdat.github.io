<p>My mother once complained that the cursor on her Sony TV (connected to a PC) was a bit small for her eyes.</p>

<p>I know that there are cursor themes but have never bothered to look into it and have used the default cursor of Debian for years. After some searching, I found one called <strong>Breeze</strong>, a series of beautiful cursor theme:</p>

<p>It comes with various color patterns and sizes, for left hand and right hand:</p>

<p>To install a cursor theme in Openbox:</p>

<p>Download the theme package, decompress it into ~/.icon/ folder on your home directory.</p>

<p>Open <strong>lxappearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Mouse cursor</strong> tab &gt; find the set of <strong>Breeze</strong> cursor you desire &gt; <strong>apply</strong>. You may need to restart your system for the change to take effect globally (system wide).</p>
