<h3 id="1-update-your-system-frequently">1. Update your system frequently</h3>

<p>Just be familiar with these two command and you good to go:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It will update the information <strong>apt</strong> is having from all repositories in <strong>/etc/apt/source.list</strong> file.</p>

<p>This command does not install package, just update information.</p>

<p>This following command will actually install newest version of any package that has been installed in your system (if any).</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You should always do it one in a while (I prefer once a week) to keep your system up to date.</p>

<p>Or just:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <strong>“&amp;&amp;”</strong> part is for telling the terminal only run the <strong>upgrade</strong> command if only the <strong>update</strong> command has been finished.</p>

<p><em><strong>*TO SUM UP:</strong>*</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>update</strong>: get information about what is the newest version of any package on the repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>upgrade</strong>: compare the version of each package installed on your computer and download the newest version of them if any.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-keep-your-system-clean">2. Keep your system clean</h3>

<p>Cleaning up the cache of <strong>apt</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>apt</strong> is keeping all the downloaded binary files (.deb) after any of your installation/update has been taken place. These <strong>.deb</strong> file are made available in case you want to reinstall or repair them. That means if you clear this cache, you need to re-download packages should the need arises later.</p>

<p>To see how much apt has been cached <strong>.deb</strong> files:</p>

<p>First, go to the apt cache directory by:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /var/cache/apt/archives
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>then:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
du -ch
</code>
**(du -ch mean:</p>

<p>du: disk usage command - return the size of a directory</p>

<p>-c: for returning total</p>

<p>-h: human - easier for us to read the output (the size will be in Megabyte unit))**</p>

<p>The command apt-get clean will <strong><em>clear all</em></strong> this cache.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>OR only <strong><em>downsizing</em></strong> the apt cache:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get autoclean
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is the more compromising way if you want to keep apt local cache but as a reasonable size. Autoclean only delete the packages that useless (partial packages) in apt cache.</p>

<p>To clean up of any unused dependencies that was left behind after you remove a package:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get autoremove
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="3-analyzed-the-usage-of-your-disk-to-find-if-there-is-any-unused-folder-hogging-space">3. Analyzed the usage of your disk to find if there is any unused folder hogging space.</h3>

<p>We will use a very good program call baobab (Disk Usage Analyzer).</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>apt-get install baobab
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You should start it with root privilege for the most information.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gksu baobab
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Disk Usage Analyzer</p>

<h3 id="4-monitor-your-system">4. Monitor your system</h3>

<p>If you feel that something has gone wrong: suddenly your fan running fast, your computer slowing down… you should use <strong>htop</strong> to find out if there are programs hogging your system resources (using a lot of CPU power or RAM).</p>

<p>Problem like this often happens because there is a program which requires resources that beyond the capability of your system or simply because the program is not configured right. For the former case, you have to find another lighter alternative that also do the trick, of course there may be some compromises. For the later, here is my own experience. I used to encounter a problem with my video configuration. The video player did not use GPU power to process video but used CPU power and cause extremely high CPU usage for no obvious reason. After tracking the problem down, I then reconfigure my GPU and everything is fine now.</p>

<p>These are typical cases that you should using system monitor to detect what is the culprit.</p>

<p>And then you should: <strong>Kill</strong> that process (to terminate it)</p>

<p>To <strong><em>kill</em></strong> a running program the hard way (force it to close) by using command in terminal when the normal way of clicking the close button on its windows do not have any effect (that program is hanging or something).</p>

<p>You can terminate a running program:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>killall [program_name]
</code></pre>
</div>
